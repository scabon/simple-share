## What

I'm not yet shure what exactly will end-up in here (or even if I will continue on with this experiment).  
But probably a mix of:  

* Links and bookmarks I find useful, Ã  la [Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli)
* Configuration options/settings I can't remember
* Troubleshooting steps
* Code samples

## Why

When playing arround with a `Rapsberry Pi`, or on a `Linux VM`, or writing `PowerShell` scripts I find mysleft searching for answsers online.  

There is not always an easy solution that matches my setup, I often have to combine steps from different sources.  
I do take notes on a `OneNote`, but it's not as efficient as full blown `Git` repo with `Markdown` pages and it is not shared, meaning I'm not helping others as others have helped me.  

## Who

I'm a Solutions Architect working at a small company.  
I am no developer, but do write some `PowerShell` and `Javascript` from time to time.
